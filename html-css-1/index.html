    <!-- In this webpage, the top level layout
         appears to be divided into four distinct
         sections.
         Depending on how the Company wanted the navbar to function,
         the content below the navbar might have its own container
         surrounding the main and footer, to facilitate easier
         positioning.

        1. Assuming that the navbar should always be easily accessible,
         * I would position the navbar fixed/ablolute,
         * I would surround the rest of the page content in its own container,
            unless the footer needed to also be always accessable
         * I would layout the company text with a re-styled H1,
           along with a nav on the right
        2. for the containers that lay out the jumbotron, the main content
           and the footer, flex wont be needed here. We can use HEADER, MAIN,
           and FOOTER respectively.
        3. for the jumbotron, we can use a h1 element to contain "THE MORE YOU KNOW",
           using margins on the h1 to provide the correct spacing.
        4. for the main content, I will try to lay it out using three flex containers
           inside the main container, using the parents margins to lay out the
           correct spacing inside the container
        5. for the footer, since the footer is empty, can just be a footer element
           with a fixed with
